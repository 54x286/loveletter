            <h1>Riku</h1>
            <p>By the time you read this, I hope I'm already fast asleep. You found this in your bag, didn't you? I had it well... but then again, you always manage to find the things I leave behind.</p>
            <p>Happy Valentine's Day, my Riku.</p>
            <p>Thank you for always taking care of me, even when I don't notice, even when I'm too lost in my own world—or perhaps, when the world moves too fast for me to keep up. But somehow, in the blur of it all, I always manage to catch a glimpse of you. And that, I think, is my greatest fortune.</p>
            <p>I have never needed to seek validation for the void inside me, never felt the restless ache of searching for something just out of reach because with you, everything settles so effortlessly. In the mundanity of this world, in its dull and quiet moments, your voice remains the gentlest tether, the kindest guide, always bringing me back to life.</p>
            <p>Would it be too much to ask the universe to let me hear your voice for the rest of my life?</p>
            <p>I love you, Riku.</p>
