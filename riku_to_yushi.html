            <p>Dear Riku,</p>
            <p>As I sit here thinking of you, my heart swells with emotions I can't fully put into words. Every moment with you feels like a gift. Youâ€™ve always been there for me, and I just want to let you know how much I appreciate you and everything you do.</p>
            <p>Yours forever,</p>
            <p>Yushi</p>
