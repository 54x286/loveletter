        <h1>Love Letter from Yushi to Riku</h1>
        <p>Dear Riku,</p>
        <p>As I sit here thinking of you, my heart swells with emotions I canâ€™t fully put into words. Every moment with you feels like a gift. You've always been there for me, and I just want to let you know how much I appreciate you and everything you do.</p>
        <p>Yours forever,<br>Yushi</p>
