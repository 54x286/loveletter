            <h1>Yushi</h1>
            <p>By the time you read this, I've probably already taken you home. You found this in your coat, didn't you? I told you I could surprise you.</p>
            <p>Happy Valentine's Day, Yushi.</p>
            <p>Thank you for always going the distance—whether it's just across a puddle or all the way to Antarctica. Even when you're tired and grumbling for food, even when your legs refuse to move, even when sleep tugs at you, you're still here. And in a world that often feels disjointed, where everything seems slightly out of place, I have found my place—with you. That, I think, is my greatest blessing.</p>
            <p>I have never felt so seen, so remembered, in a world that forgets too easily—where everything has an expiration date, where moments slip away before we even grasp them. But with you, time slows just enough. And for as long as I have time left in this world, I want to spend every moment with you.</p>
            <p>Would that be too much to ask?</p>
            <p>I love you, Yushi.</p>
            <p>P.S. I'm sorry I overdid it.</p>
